# Observations
For the X̄ chart, the UCL = 53.60583 and the LCL =  47.27217. 

For the R chart, the UCL = 9.91942 and the LCL = 0. These are our trial limits.

The X̄ chart shows that the mean of all sample points used lie within the trial limits. (Detecting changes in the process average mean)
The R chart shows that the range of all sample points used lie within the trial limits. (Detecting changes in the process variabilty)

# Remarks
From the X̄ and R charts, the process of production is under statistical control since their is no point that lies outside the control limits
